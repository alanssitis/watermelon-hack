# GenGen

## For happy and healthy interactions.

GenGen is a web app that can help generate generosity within communities.
Within the community you join, you can be a "generator" and post your offers to
help others who may benefit from your skillsets, time, company, ..., and
generosity! Simply select a category to tag and offer your help.

You can also request help from these offers, and after your request is accepted
by the generator, you will swiftly be connected to each other for contact.
Requestees can gift "Genz" and reviews to demonstrate gratitude for the
generators. Whether it be on a college campus, company, or neighborhood, GenGen
will be there for you.
